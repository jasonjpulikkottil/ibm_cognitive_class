    "An autoencoder, also known as autoassociator or Diabolo networks, is an artificial neural network employed to recreate the given input.\n",
    "It takes a set of <b>unlabeled</b> inputs, encodes them and then tries to extract the most valuable information from them.\n",
    "They are used for feature extraction, learning generative models of data, dimensionality reduction and can be used for compression. \n",
    "\n",
    "A 2006 paper named <b><a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/science.pdf\">Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks</a>, done by G. E. Hinton and R. R. Salakhutdinov</b>, showed better results than years of refining other types of network, and was a breakthrough in the field of Neural Networks, a field that was \"stagnant\" for 10 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, autoencoders, based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, are employed in some of the largest deep learning applications. They are the building blocks of Deep Belief Networks (DBN).\n",

    "Running deep learning programs usually needs a high performance platform. __PowerAI__ speeds up deep learning and AI. Built on IBM’s Power Systems, __PowerAI__ is a scalable software platform that accelerates deep learning and AI with blazing performance for individual users or enterprises. The __PowerAI__ platform supports popular machine learning libraries and dependencies including TensorFlow, Caffe, Torch, and Theano. You can use [PowerAI on IMB Cloud](https://cocl.us/ML0120EN_PAI).\n",

    "Also, you can use __Watson Studio__ to run these notebooks faster with bigger datasets.__Watson Studio__ is IBM’s leading cloud solution for data scientists, built by data scientists. With Jupyter notebooks, RStudio, Apache Spark and popular libraries pre-packaged in the cloud, __Watson Studio__ enables data scientists to collaborate on their projects without having to install anything. Join the fast-growing community of __Watson Studio__ users today with a free account at [Watson Studio](https://cocl.us/ML0120EN_DSX).This is the end of this lesson. Thank you for reading this notebook, and good luck on your studies."
